## Trapping rainwater

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Example:

*Input:* `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`

*Output:* `6`

The elevation map is represented in the example is represented by the black lines in the image below. The blue lines represent the water that will be trapped.
